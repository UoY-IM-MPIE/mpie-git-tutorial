# An introduction to git and how we'll use it in this module

Unity projects are large and comprise a very large number of files. This means that it’s often impractical and very slow to store and run them from a file server like your university storage drive. For this reason, we recommend you use git to store your work in this module.

Git has a bit of a learning curve but using it will mean you’ll be able to spend more time working on creative projects in this module and less time waiting for files to upload! Git is also the industry standard version control system. Therefore, learning it now will benefit you in the future.

This document explains how you can use git to save your work to a remote server and then access it later from another computer. We’ll be using GitHub as a hosting service and the GitHub desktop app to keep things simple. However, if you’d like to learn how to use git via the command line and/or another hosting service just ask.

**Please try and complete these steps BEFORE the practical class – you’ll have Unity work to do in the practical! However, if you get stuck, please do ask for help in the practical.**
