# An introduction to git and how we'll use it in this module

Unity projects are large and comprise a very large number of files. This means that it’s often impractical and very slow to store and run them from a file server like your university storage drive. For this reason, we recommend you use git to store your work in this module. We will also be hosting all of the intructions and files for practical exercises for the module on GitHub too.

Git has a bit of a learning curve, but using it will mean you’ll be able to spend more time working on creative projects in this module and less time waiting for files to upload! Git is also the industry standard version control system. Therefore, learning it now will benefit you in the future.

This document explains how you can use git to save your work to a remote server and then access it later from another computer. We’ll be using GitHub as a hosting service and the GitHub desktop app to keep things simple. However, if you’d like to learn how to use git via the command line and/or another hosting service just ask.

**Please try and complete these steps BEFORE the practical class – you’ll have Unity work to do in the practical! However, if you get stuck, please do ask for help in the practical.**

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

The first thing you’ll need to do is create a GitHub personal account. To do this, go to https://github.com and follow the instructions to create your account. If you’re already got a GitHub account, please feel free to use that of course.

If you sign up using your university email, you’ll be eligible to apply for a student account that offers some otherwise paid features for free here: https://education.github.com/students 

## Step 2: Creating your First Repository

A git repository is a place where you can save your code (and multiple versions of it, but let’s not worry about that for now). I’d recommend that you create a unique repository for every Unity project in this module (i.e. one per practical class). In this step, we’re going to create your first repository.

To get started, open the GitHub Desktop application – you can find it under Spotlight Search for GitHub Desktop – and login. Once you’ve logged in, choose “Create a new repository on your hard drive” on the page that appears.
